# PAWRA - Machine Learning Model
This model is the basis of the PAWRA system, which is able to estimate the possibility of a dog experiencing depression dan anxiety by relying on an analysis of the dog's activity records.
# Compatible Version
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow 2.14
- Sastrawi 1.0
- Numpy 1.23
- NLTK 3.8
- Pandas 1.5
# How to use it?
- To use this model, you can download it via the Code button above. Then, you can clone this repository on your local PC or download it in zip format.
- If you download it in zip format, you can extract it wherever you like, as long as your IDE can access it. You can also use Google Colab or Kaggle to access it by uploading it yourself to these platforms. Make sure the IDE or platform you are using can use Jupyter Notebook so you can access the helper.ipnb file.
- After that, you can access the folder.
- Open the helper.ipynb file in the folder and run all the cells.
- By using the preprocess_to_predict function, you can input a dog's daily activity record to predict the possibility that the dog is depressed and anxious.
